# TransXChange

It is a data format providing a means to exchange bus routes and timetables between multiple computer systems.
Each bus stop is identified using the NAPTAN standard.
There are 2 main schemas, Registration and General. Registration is used for VOSA (now DVLA) but we only need to worry about General Schemas.

# What does TransXChange Exchange?

TransXChange schemas can be used to exchange the following information:
- Bus schedules including stops, routes, departures times / frequencies, operational notes, and maps. Routes may have complex topologies such as circular routes, cloverleaf and lollipops, and complex workings such as short working and express patterns. Connections with other services can also be described
- - The days on which the services run, including availability on public holidays and other exceptions.
- Term times and holidays of Schools, Local Educational Authorities and other organisations serviced by a bus service.
- Details of the statutory Registration of the Service with a Traffic Area Office, including any Short Notice Registration details.
- Information about the Bus Operators providing the service.
- Additional operational information, including fare stages, positioning runs, garages, layovers, duty crews, useful for AVL and on-board ticketing systems.
- Information about accessibility of stops and services for wheelchair and other users
